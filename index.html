SPO is a work-in-progress, searchable database cataloguing the prefaces, dedications, epistles and other paratextual materials authored or designed by English printers, publishers, and booksellers between 1500-1700. This resource aims to support scholars of early modern book history and print culture by providing granular detail about where, when, and how often stationers contributed to the ways printed books were advisertised, purchased, and studied.
