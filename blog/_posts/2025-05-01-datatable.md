title: DataTable in Progress!
---

The <a href="https://andiesilva.github.io/celeste//pages/datatable.html">Browse</a> page is live with all the recorded entries from William's <em>Index</em>. I'm currently working on adding search and filter capabilities to the table, hopefully to be completed by Fall 2025! Individual entries will also eventually have their own pages with detailed information.

### Dataset Updates: May 2025

The first 100 entries for an expanded dataset focusing on women stationers (1640-1700) have been published! I am working off roughly 3,000 EEBO entries tagged under "Women and Publishing." I have currently reviewed about half of these entries, and hope to finish the last 1,500 records this summer. The complete dataset will expand the range covered by Williams and shed light on the siginificant contributions women made to the English print marketplace.

### Dataset Updates: February 2025

I'm currently working on biographical data for printers, publishers, and booksellers listed in the database. Recent cyber attacks on various academic projects have taken down the <em>British Book Trade Index</em>. Thanks to the work of Janelle Jenstad and Martin Holmes at the University of Victoria, the project has been rescued and preserved at <a href=
"https://hcmc.uvic.ca/project/bbti/">https://hcmc.uvic.ca/project/bbti/</a>. Biographical information, will offer links to ODNB, BBTI, and the <a href="https://data.cerl.org/thesaurus">CERL Thesaurus</a> where relevant.
