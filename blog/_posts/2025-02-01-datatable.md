title: DataTable in Progress!
---

The <a href="https://andiesilva.github.io/celeste//pages/datatable.html">Browse</a> page is live with all the recorded entries from William's <em>Index</em>. I'm currently working on adding search and filter capabilities to the table, hopefully to be completed by end of Spring 2025! Individual entries will also eventually have their own pages with detailed information.

### Dataset Updates

I'm currently working on biographical data for printers, publishers, and booksellers listed in the database. Recent cyber attacks on various academic projects have taken down the <em>British Book Trade Index</em>. Thanks to the work of Janelle Jenstad and Martin Holmes at the University of Victoria, the project has been rescued and preserved at <a href=
"https://hcmc.uvic.ca/project/bbti/">https://hcmc.uvic.ca/project/bbti/</a>. Biographical information, will offer links to ODNB, BBTI, and the <a href="https://data.cerl.org/thesaurus>CERL Thesaurus</a> where relevant.

### Download

Researchers are always invited to dowload the most up-to-date datasets from <a href="https://github.com/andiesilva/stationersparatextsonline">GitHub</a>. <a href="mailto:asilva@york.cuny.edu">Let me know</a> if you do anything cool with this data!
