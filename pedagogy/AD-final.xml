                <p>SINCE my late setting foorth of the <title>Faerie Queene</title>, finding
                        that it hath found a fauourable passage amongst you; I have sithence
                        endeuoured by all good meanes (for the better encrease and accomplishment of
                        your delights,) to get into my handes such smale Poemes of the same Authors;
                        as I heard were disperst abroad in sundrie hands, and not easie to bee come
                        by, by himselfe; some of them hauing bene diuerslie imbeziled and purloyned
                        from him, since his departure ouer Sea. Of which I haue by good meanes
                        gathered togeather these fewe parcels present, which I haue caused to bee
                        imprinted al-<pb n="sig. A2v"/>

                        togeather, for that they al seeme to containe like matter of
                        argument in them: being all complaints and meditations of the world's
                        vanitie, verie graue and profitable. To which effect I vnderstand that he
                        besides wrote sundrie others, namelie <title rend="italics">Ecclesiastes</title>, &amp;
                    <title rend="italics">Canticum canticorum</title> translated, <title rend="italics">A senights

                            Purgatorie</title>, being all dedicated to Ladies; so as it may seeme he
                        ment them all to one volume. Besides some other Pamphlets looselie scattered
                        abroad: as <title rend="italics">The dying Pellican</title>, <title rend="italics">The howers of the
                            Lord</title>, <title rend="italics">The scarifice of a sinner</title>, <title rend="italics">The seuen
                            Psalmes, &amp;tc</title>. which when I can either by
                        himselfe, or otherwise attaine too, I meane likewise for your fauour sake to
                        set foorth. In the meane time praying you gentlie to accept of these, and
                        graciouslie to entertaine the new Poet.</p> <closer rend="italics"><salute>I take
