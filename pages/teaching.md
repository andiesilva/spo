       <p>I encourage scholars and learners to make use of this project in their classrooms. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzwhQ0kvPaKYDQHH_PaiRHXwLbqequWn_QGUqIJVtmY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find a sample prompt I've used in my Medieval and Renaissance Studies course to produce TEI-encoded transcriptions of a short number of paratexts. This work is adapted from Laura Estill's <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/9781802701258-009" target="_blank">“Encoding Early Modern Commonplace Books in the Classroom</a>,” in <i>Using Commonplace Books to Enrich Medieval and Renaissance Courses</i>, edited by Sarah E. Parker and Andie Silva (pp.119-140).</p>

        <h2>Some Considerations</h2>
        <li>The assignment prompt, sample TEI template, and "encoding cheatsheet" are available for download in the project's <a href="https://github.com/andiesilva/spo/tree/3e883540903bdf382e732db9fdb278812c278ab3/pedagogy" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
      <li>I originally taught this assignment in a literature survey course, where students had varying comfort levels with technology. We worked from a template with the TEI header mostly pre-written, with placeholders and comments where the students were to add their own information.</li>
        <li>An in-class workshop (preferably on a computer lab) is imperative for hands-on practice and to give opportunities for peer support.</li>
        <li>Following Estill, I also set up in-class exercises for students to 1) work on their their transcriptions; 2) proofread their work with a peer; and 3) highlight the textual elements they wished to mark up, such as page breaks, gaps, and publication titles.</li>
        <li>I left it open as to whether students would normalize their transcriptions or not. Some students chose to employ the 'choice' element to offer both options to readers. Folks seeking consistency in the submitted work may require students to stick to one, pre-determined option.</li>
        <li>The original work for this assignment was produced in Fall 2025 in a class titled "AI before AI," in which we discussed the connections and differences between AI and print as technological shifts. As such, we had <i>one</i> in-class exercise where I launched CoPilot to show students how GenAI has been used in programming. The result of that page (which was generated in my local machine) is linked above, in association with Kaylah Agard's work.</li>
        <li>In order to bypass the fact that we didn't have Oxygen licenses or a quick way to pre-install the software in our school computers, we used a simple online XML editor. For more hands-on learning with TEI, instructors may consider <a href="https://www.leaf-vre.org/" target="_blank">LEAF VRE</a>'s <a href="https://leaf-writer.leaf-vre.org/" target="_blank">Leaf Writer</a>, instead.</li>
